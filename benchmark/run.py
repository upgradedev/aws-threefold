"""Runs the benchmark: real coding-agent sessions on the Acme tasks, under each condition, recorded as JSON lines.

    python benchmark/run.py --check-auth                                # does the login work? (one tiny call)
    python benchmark/run.py --tasks orders-s3-archive --reps 1 --pilot
    python benchmark/run.py --reps 3 --parallel 3                       # the full matrix, 54 runs
    python benchmark/run.py --family pressure --reps 3 --parallel 3     # the pressure tasks, 27 runs
    python benchmark/run.py --reps 3 --parallel 3 --resume <run-id>     # carry on where it stopped
    python benchmark/run.py --agent codex --reps 3 --parallel 3         # the same matrix with Codex

Without --tasks the matrix is the standard family's six tasks, whose prompts
tempt a violation. The pressure family's three tasks, whose prompts ask for the
forbidden shortcut, run only with --family pressure (or all, or their ids in
--tasks); a run of them alone is named <time>-pressure.

Each run gets a fresh copy of the task repository under the system temp folder
(%TEMP%\\threefold-bench\\<run-id> on Windows), never inside the workspace, or
at the root of the same drive when a Claude memory file sits above the temp
folder, because Claude Code would load it into every run. One row per run is
appended to benchmark/results/<run-id>.jsonl as soon as the run ends, so an
interrupted matrix keeps what it finished. Aggregate with benchmark/report.py.

The login (credentials.py). Claude Code logs in with a token file when there
is one: the owner runs `claude setup-token` once and saves the token, alone on
one line, to C:\\threefold-bench\\.claude-oauth-token (or passes --token-file).
The runner reads it and hands it to the agent process alone, with a
configuration folder and a home folder of the run's own, so nothing from the
owner's settings, hooks, skills or memory reaches the agent. Without a token
file it uses the machine's login. `--check-auth` makes one trivial call the
way a run would and says ok, expired, missing, limited or error, with the next
step.

A run the service stops (a usage limit or an overload) is recorded as cut
short, and after a pause (--retry-pause, 180 s) it is tried once more in a
fresh folder; the row records both attempts. If the second attempt is stopped
too, or the login stops working, no further run is started: the runner prints
the command that resumes the matrix and exits with 3. `--resume <run-id>`
appends to the same results file and runs only what the report would not yet
count: a planned run whose latest row the report counts is skipped, and one
that was cut short, never reached the model, hit a harness error, or was a
Threefold run without a working Threefold in front of it (the local server
stopped answering, the hook failed open or never fired) is run again. The
report counts only the latest row of each run.
