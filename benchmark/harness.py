"""How one benchmark run is set up, driven and measured.

A run is one task under one condition, in a fresh copy of the task's template:

    none               the repository as it is
    prompt             the team's rules written into the repository's CLAUDE.md
    threefold          the Threefold hook installed in the repository, in enforce
                       mode, talking to a local Threefold server started from this
                       repository's own source for this run alone
    prompt+threefold   both (not in the default matrix)

The Threefold conditions can instead report to a Threefold that is already
running elsewhere, a remote endpoint (RemoteThreefold): nothing is started, the
hook in the task repository names that endpoint, a project `Acme-Live-<task>`
and a session `live-<task>-<date>`, and what the run left in that Threefold's
ledger is read back through its public API (GET /api/decisions) instead of
from a local server. That is how a daily real agent puts its session on the
public demo's ledger (scripts/daily_live_agent.py). The endpoint must be https,
or http to this machine for a stand-in; nothing else about a run changes.

The agent is Claude Code (`claude -p`) or Codex (`codex exec`, see
codex_agent.py). For Codex the prompt condition writes the rules to AGENTS.md
and the Threefold condition registers the hook in `.codex/hooks.json`, both
the way the installer does.

Everything a run sets up lives in its own directory under the work root, which
is outside the workspace: the repository, the agent's transcript, the hook's
local state (THREEFOLD_HOME) and the home folder the hook expands `~` against.
The harness never reads or writes the owner's ~/.threefold, and no THREEFOLD_*
variable from the owner's shell reaches the agent or the hook, so a run can
only ever report to its own local server.

A Claude Code login token read from a token file (credentials.py) is placed in
one environment only, the agent process's, and only for a run with a
configuration folder of its own. It is never on a command line, in a file the
harness writes, or in a row: the sanitiser replaces it, in every text shape a
copy can take, in everything recorded, and after each run everything under the
run's folder is searched for it, names included, and any copy found is
removed without ever writing through a link (scrub_secret).

What the agent itself can reach is narrower than the machine but not sealed.
Claude Code confines its file edits to the repository, reads outside the
repository are not granted, the owner's private folders are denied by name,
and the shell is limited to the commands the tasks need. Those commands run
the tests and the task's own programs, though, and code the agent writes runs
with the owner's rights: no permission rule reaches inside a Python or .NET
process. The benchmark is safe to run because the tasks give an agent no
reason to leave its repository and the environment removes the easy ways
(no AWS credentials, no package index), not because leaving is impossible.

#   against the path relative to the working directory, the task repository;
#   a path outside it never matches. So `Read(./**)` and `Edit(./**)` cover the
#   repository and nothing else, where the bare names `Read` and `Edit` would
#   cover every path on the machine. An Edit rule governs Write, MultiEdit and
#   NotebookEdit as well, and a Read rule governs Glob and Grep. Reads inside
#   the working directory need no rule; outside it they need one, and in print
#   mode nothing can grant it, so they are refused.
# - `Bash(x:*)` matches a command that starts with x and nothing else, so the
#   list names the commands the tasks need and no bare interpreter:
#   `Bash(python:*)` would admit `python -c` with anything after it. The test
#   runners and `dotnet run` still execute code the agent wrote, which no

Written by benchmark/harness.py. The hook reads THREEFOLD_HOME and expands ~
for its local lists and logs; both point into this run, so the owner's
~/.threefold is never read or written, and no inherited THREEFOLD_* variable
can send a call anywhere but the local server the repository's .threefold.json
names. A login token the agent may have inherited is removed before the hook
starts: the hook has no use for it.

Each call adds one line to the run's hook log, with no content: whether the
hook printed a decision, whether that decision refused the call and which gate
refused it (a name such as CREDENTIAL, never the reason's words), whether it
let the call through unjudged, and whether it crashed. Codex prints no hook
events of its own, so for Codex this log is the evidence that the hook ran,
and the record of a refusal that never reached the server, such as a
credential refused on the machine.

When the run names a session (a run reporting to a remote Threefold), the
call the agent hands over is sent under that session instead of the agent's
own id; anything that is not a JSON object is passed on untouched.

    The scripted self-test calls the hook itself, so it cannot show that Claude
    Code loads the hook from .claude/settings.local.json under the flags the
    runner passes. This can: a Threefold run whose agent made governed calls
    but left no decision in the ledger, no refusal in the transcript and no
    hook event is not a measurement of Threefold, and the report rejects it.
    A credential refusal never reaches the server, which is why the
    transcript counts as evidence too.

    `governance_observed` is the stricter fact: Threefold judged something,
    shown by a decision in the ledger or a refusal in the transcript. A hook
    event alone shows only that the hook started, and a hook that cannot reach
    its server starts, prints nothing and lets the call through.

    Governed calls are counted by the agent's own names: Codex reports
    `command_execution` and `file_change` items, not Claude Code's tools, so
    with Claude Code's list every Codex run would look as though it made no
    governed call and could never be caught without its hook. Codex's hook
    events are the per-run wrapper's log (codex_agent.read_hook_log).

    For Codex that count is a floor, not a total. The 2026-09-23 runs showed
    that a call the hook refused leaves no item in `codex exec --json` at all,
    so `governed_calls` is short by exactly the refused calls - the ones this
    check is about. It is safe in the direction that matters: `hook_missing`
    asks whether a run with governed calls left no trace of the hook, and the
    hook's own log is read beside the JSON (read_agent_transcript), so a run
    whose only governed call was refused still counts as one where the hook
    fired. A reader who wants the number of governed calls wants the log.
