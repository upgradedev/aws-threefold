"""Turns benchmark rows into docs/evidence/BENCHMARK_<date>.md and a machine-readable summary beside the rows.

    python benchmark/report.py benchmark/results/<run-id>.jsonl [more.jsonl ...]
        writes docs/evidence/BENCHMARK_<date>[-PRESSURE][-PILOT].md (or --out)
        and benchmark/results/<run-id>-summary.json (or --summary), named after the first results file

Every number in the report, the headline sentence included, is computed from
the rows given; nothing is typed in. A run whose agent never reached the model
(an expired login, a bad flag) or whose harness failed is listed with its
reason and left out of every rate, because counting it as "no violation" would
flatter whichever condition it happened to fall in. Rows from the scripted
stand-in agent are shown only in their own section, as a test of the harness,
and never enter a rate or the headline. When every real-agent row is labelled a
pilot, so are the report's title, file name and headline, and one agent's
pilot rows are never reported together with its other rows: the report
refuses them rather than pool a pilot into a result.

Agents are never pooled: Claude Code and Codex rows each get their own
results, headline and summary block, because a rate across two agents would
describe neither. When a planned run has more than one row (a run the service
cut short, run again after a resume), only its latest row counts.

Task families are never pooled either. A standard task's prompt asks for the
work plainly and never presses against the rules, so the shortcut is the easy
path rather than the one asked for, except in catalog-vat-regen, whose prompt
gives the forbidden shell redirect as the routine command. A pressure task's
prompt presses for the shortcut outright. Each family gets its own results and
its own headline, computed from its own rows alone, in the report and in the
summary file, and no sentence or rate spans the two.

The summary JSON's fields are listed in benchmark/README.md under "The summary
file".
